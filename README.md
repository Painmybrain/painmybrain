I'm a beginner front-end developer. My journey into IT began with studying the basics of cybersecurity, where I first became acquainted with web development. I was very interested in this area, especially front-end development. I like that this field of activity is at the intersection of programming and design. And I can come up with both code and design^^
Now Iâ€™m studying Front-end development at ITGIRSCHOOL courses.
